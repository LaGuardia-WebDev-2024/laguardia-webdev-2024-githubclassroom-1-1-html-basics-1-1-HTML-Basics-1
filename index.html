    <h1>
      So Sick by Ne-Yo
    </h1>
    <p>
      Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do <br>
Oh, yeah<br>
Gotta change my answering machine<br>
Now that I'm alone<br>
'Cause right now it says that we can't come to the phone<br>
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door<br>
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore<br>
It's been months, and for some reason I just (can't get over us)<br>
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (enough is enough)<br>
No more walking around with my head down (yeah)<br>
I'm so over being blue, crying over you<br>
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears<br>
So done with wishing you were still here<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow<br>
So, why can't I turn off the radio?<br>
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th<br>
'Cause since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary<br>
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory<br>
And now every song reminds me of what used to be<br>
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears<br>
So done with wishing you were still here<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow<br>
So, why can't I turn off the radio?<br>
Oh, (leave me alone) leave me alone<br>
(Stupid love songs) oh-oh, hey<br>
Don't make me think about her smile (ooh)<br>
Or having my first child<br>
I'm letting go<br>
Turning off the radio<br>
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (hey), so tired of tears (so tired of tears)<br>
So done with wishing (oh-ooh) she was still here<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (whoa)<br>
So, why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (so tired of tears)<br>
So done with wishing she was still here<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (hey)<br>
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)<br>
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (I'm so sick, I'm so sick of love songs)<br>
So done with wishing you were still here (and I'm so sick, I'm so sick of love songs)<br>
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (said I'm so sick, I'm so sick of love songs, hey)<br>
So, why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)<br>
Why can't I turn off the radio?
